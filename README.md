# Fossil-Fighters-Graphics-Editor
This is just a nice tool to make editing Fossil Fighters graphics easy. All you have to do is drag your ROM onto start.exe, and the code will split it apart and
convert the graphics. The converted files must then be edited with NitroPaint: https://github.com/Garhoogin/NitroPaint/releases. When you are done, drag your
ROM onto finish.exe, and a new one will be created with all the changes.
