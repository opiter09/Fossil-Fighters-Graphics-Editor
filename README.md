# Fossil-Fighters-Graphics-Editor
This is just a nice tool to make editing Fossil Fighters graphics easy. All you have to do is drag your ROM onto start.exe, and the code will split it apart and
convert the graphics. The converted files must then be edited with NitroPaint, provided here for convenience. When you are done, you just drag
your ROM onto start.exe again, and as long as the three folders it made are still there, it will rebuild you a new ROM.

To download this, if you are confused, press the Green "Code" button in the top right, then choose "Download ZIP."

NOTE: None of the graphics have names or anything, they're just numbers. To make things a little easier, however, every directory has a file named "combo.txt," which
lists all of the non-arc files in motion and image, along with what sprites and palettes they use. You can thus match things up this way, but remember the golden rule:
if you can't tell what it is, don't mess with it.
