# Fossil-Fighters-Graphics-Editor
This is just a nice tool to make editing Fossil Fighters graphics easy. All you have to do is drag your ROM onto start.exe, and the code will split it apart and
convert the graphics. The converted files must then be edited with NitroPaint: https://github.com/Garhoogin/NitroPaint/releases. When you are done, you just drag
your ROM onto start.exe again, and as long as the three folders it made are still there, it will rebuild you a new ROM.

To download this, if you are confused, press the Green "Code" button in the top right, then choose "Download ZIP."
